# Lesson: Doing More With Java Rich Internet Applications

Applets launched by using the Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) have capabilities similar to those of Java Web Start applications. This lesson contains topics common to the development and deployment of applets and Java Web Start applications (together known as rich Internet applications). If you are unfamiliar with applets or Java Web Start applications, you can learn more in the following lessons of the Java Tutorials:

<li>To learn more about applet development and deployment, visit the 
[Java Applets](../applet/index.html) lesson.</li>
<li>To learn more about the development and deployment of Java Web Start applications, visit the
