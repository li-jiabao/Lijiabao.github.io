# Creating a Project

The easiest way to learn about JavaBeans is to start using them. To begin, [download and install the latest version of NetBeans](http://netbeans.org/). This tutorial describes how to use NetBeans version 7.0.

NetBeans is a *bean builder tool*, which means it recognizes JavaBeans components (beans) and enables you to snap components together into an application with ease.

## A Button is a Bean

Start NetBeans. Choose **File &gt; New Project...** from the menu.

Select **Java** from the **Categories** list and select **Java Application** from the **Projects** list. Click **Next &gt;**.

Enter **SnapApp** as the application name. Uncheck **Create Main Class** and click **Finish**. NetBeans creates the new project and you can see it in NetBeans' **Projects** pane:

Control-click on the **SnapApp** project and choose **New &gt; JFrame Form...** from the popup menu.

Fill in **SnapFrame** for the class name and **snapapp** as the package. Click **Finish**. NetBeans creates the new class and shows its visual designer:

In the **Projects** pane on the left, you can see the newly created `SnapFrame` class. In the center of the screen is the NetBeans visual designer. On the right side is the **Palette**, which contains all the components you can add to the frame in the visual designer.
