This trail describes JNDI&#8482; (Java Naming and Directory Interface) an API to access the directory and naming services. Here you learn about the basic naming and directory services and how to use JNDI to write simple applications to use these services. The most popular directory service LDAP is used to demostrate the use of JNDI to access the directory services.

**Note:** This tutorial trail is based on the standalone JNDI tutorial located at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/). The standalone JNDI tutorial, last updated under Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4.2, provides comprehensive coverage on JNDI, but is no longer supported. This tutorial excerpts the basics from the standlone tutorial and includes features added to JNDI in the Java Platform Standard Edition 5.0 and 6 releases.

The older JNDI tutorial is preserved as an archive on [docs.oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/).
