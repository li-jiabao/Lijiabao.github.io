# Trail: 2D Graphics

This trail introduces you to the Java 2D&#8482; API and shows you how to display and print 2D graphics in your Java programs. The trail is intended for developers who want to enrich their knowledge of the Java 2D API, as well as for beginners in computer graphics. Almost every section contains relevant examples to illustrate specific capabilities. The Java 2D API enables you to easily perform the following tasks:

- Draw lines, rectangles and any other geometric shape.
- Fill those shapes with solid colors or gradients and textures.
- Draw text with options for fine control over the font and rendering process.
- Draw images, optionally applying filtering operations.
- Apply operations such as compositing and transforming during any of the above rendering operations.

This chapter also explains less familiar concepts such as compositing.

This chapter describes the concept of drawing on-screen and off-screen images, as well as surfaces and printer devices. This trail covers the most common uses of the Java 2D APIs and briefly describes some of the more advanced features.

[<img src="../images/coreIcon.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Overview of the Java 2D Graphics API**](overview/index.html) introduces the key Java 2D concepts and describes the Java 2D rendering model. This lesson is more conceptual than other lessons of this trail, it enables you to get deep into basic notions and classes descriptions.

[<img src="../images/coreIcon.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Getting started with Graphics**](basic2d/index.html) uses a developed example to show you how to obtain a Graphics object and use it for common graphics rendering tasks.

[<img src="../images/coreIcon.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Working with Geometry**](geometry/index.html) teaches you how to use APIs to draw graphic primitives and arbitrary shapes, and how to apply fancy strokes and fill styles.

[<img src="../images/coreIcon.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Working with Text APIs**](text/index.html) shows you how to effectively use text APIs, including how to create a `Font` object with desired attributes, measure text, and determine the names of the fonts available on your system.

[<img src="../images/coreIcon.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Working with Images**](images/index.html) explains how to create a BufferedImage object, perform image-filtering operations, and draw on an image.

[<img src="../images/coreIcon.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Printing**](printing/index.html) teaches you how to render 2D graphics to a printer, print complex documents, and use Print Services.

[<img src="../images/coreIcon.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Advanced topics in Java 2D**](advanced/index.html) explains how to perform transformations, clip the drawing region, composite overlapping graphics, specify rendering preferences, and control rendering quality.
