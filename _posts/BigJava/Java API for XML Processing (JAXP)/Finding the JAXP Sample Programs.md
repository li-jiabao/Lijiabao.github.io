A set of JAXP sample programs is provided in the JAXP download bundle that is available from 
[Project JAXP](http://jaxp.java.net/). After you install JAXP, the sample programs are found in the directory <tt>*INSTALL_DIR*/jaxp-*version*/samples</tt>.

The sample programs are intended to be run on the 
[Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) version 6 or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
