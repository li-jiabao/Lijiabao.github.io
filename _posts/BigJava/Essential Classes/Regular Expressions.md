This lesson explains how to use the <code>
[`java.util.regex`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/package-summary.html)</code> API for pattern matching with regular expressions. Although the syntax accepted by this package is similar to the 
[Perl](http://www.perl.com) programming language, knowledge of Perl is not a prerequisite. This lesson starts with the basics, and gradually builds to cover more advanced techniques.
