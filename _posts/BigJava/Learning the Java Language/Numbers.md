This section begins with a discussion of the 
[`Number`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Number.html) class in the `java.lang` package, its subclasses, and the situations where you would use instantiations of these classes rather than the primitive number types.

This section also presents the 
[`PrintStream`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html) and 
[`DecimalFormat`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html) classes, which provide methods for writing formatted numerical output.

Finally, the 
[`Math`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html) class in `java.lang` is discussed. It contains mathematical functions to complement the operators built into the language. This class has methods for the trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and so forth.
