
# The for Statement

The `for` statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. Programmers often refer to it as the "for loop" because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied. The general form of the `for` statement can be expressed as follows:

```

for (**initialization**; **termination**;
     **increment**) {
    **statement(s)**
}

```

When using this version of the `for` statement, keep in mind that:

- The **initialization** expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.
- When the **termination** expression evaluates to `false`, the loop terminates.
- The **increment** expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment *or* decrement a value.

The following program, 
[`ForDemo`](examples/ForDemo.java), uses the general form of the `for` statement to print the numbers 1 through 10 to standard output:

```


class ForDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
         for(int i=1; i&lt;11; i++){
              System.out.println("Count is: " + i);
         }
    }
}

```

The output of this program is:

```

Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
Count is: 6
Count is: 7
Count is: 8
Count is: 9
Count is: 10

```

Notice how the code declares a variable within the initialization expression. The scope of this variable extends from its declaration to the end of the block governed by the `for` statement, so it can be used in the termination and increment expressions as well. If the variable that controls a `for` statement is not needed outside of the loop, it's best to declare the variable in the initialization expression. The names `i`, `j`, and `k` are often used to control `for` loops; declaring them within the initialization expression limits their life span and reduces errors.

The three expressions of the `for` loop are optional; an infinite loop can be created as follows:

```

// infinite loop
for ( ; ; ) {
    
    // your code goes here
}

```

The `for` statement also has another form designed for iteration through 
[Collections](../../collections/index.html) and 
[arrays](arrays.html) This form is sometimes referred to as the *enhanced for* statement, and can be used to make your loops more compact and easy to read. To demonstrate, consider the following array, which holds the numbers 1 through 10:

```

int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};

```

The following program, 
[`EnhancedForDemo`](examples/EnhancedForDemo.java), uses the enhanced `for` to loop through the array:

```


class EnhancedForDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
         int[] numbers = 
             {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
         for (int item : numbers) {
             System.out.println("Count is: " + item);
         }
    }
}

```

In this example, the variable `item` holds the current value from the numbers array. The output from this program is the same as before:

```

Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
Count is: 6
Count is: 7
Count is: 8
Count is: 9
Count is: 10

```

We recommend using this form of the `for` statement instead of the general form whenever possible.
