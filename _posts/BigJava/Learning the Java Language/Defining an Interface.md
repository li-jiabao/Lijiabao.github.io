
# Defining an Interface

An interface declaration consists of modifiers, the keyword `interface`, the interface name, a comma-separated list of parent interfaces (if any), and the interface body. For example:

```

public interface GroupedInterface extends Interface1, Interface2, Interface3 {

    // constant declarations
    
    // base of natural logarithms
    double E = 2.718282;
 
    // method signatures
    void doSomething (int i, double x);
    int doSomethingElse(String s);
}

```

The `public` access specifier indicates that the interface can be used by any class in any package. If you do not specify that the interface is public, then your interface is accessible only to classes defined in the same package as the interface.

An interface can extend other interfaces, just as a class subclass or extend another class. However, whereas a class can extend only one other class, an interface can extend any number of interfaces. The interface declaration includes a comma-separated list of all the interfaces that it extends.

## The Interface Body

The interface body can contain
[abstract methods](../../java/IandI/abstract.html),
[default methods](../../java/IandI/defaultmethods.html), and
[static methods](../../java/IandI/defaultmethods.html#static). An abstract method within an interface is followed by a semicolon, but no braces (an abstract method does not contain an implementation). Default methods are defined with the `default` modifier, and static methods with the `static` keyword. All abstract, default, and static methods in an interface are implicitly `public`, so you can omit the `public` modifier.

In addition, an interface can contain constant declarations. All constant values defined in an interface are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`. Once again, you can omit these modifiers.
