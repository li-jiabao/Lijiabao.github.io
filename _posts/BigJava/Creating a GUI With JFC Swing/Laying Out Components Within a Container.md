
# Lesson: Laying Out Components Within a Container


This lesson tells you how to use the layout managers
provided by the Java platform. It also tells you how to use absolute positioning (no layout manager)
and gives an example of writing a custom layout manager.
 
 For each layout manager (or lack thereof), this 
lesson
points to an example that you can run using Java&#8482; Web Start. By resizing an example's window, you can see how size changes affect the layout.

[Creating a Custom Layout Manager](custom.html)


Layout managers must implement the `LayoutManager` interface, which specifies the five methods every layout manager must define. Optionally, layout managers can implement `LayoutManager2`, which is a subinterface of `LayoutManager`.

[Doing Without a Layout Manager (Absolute Positioning)](none.html)


If necessary, you can position components without using a layout manager.  Generally, this solution is used to specify absolute sizes and positions for components.

[Solving Common Layout Problems](problems.html)


Some of the most common layout problems involve components that are displayed too small &#151; or not at all. 
This section
tells you how to fix these and other common layout problems.
