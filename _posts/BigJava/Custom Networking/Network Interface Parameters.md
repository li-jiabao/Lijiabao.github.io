Though you are probably already familiar with cookies, you might not know how to take advantage of them in your Java application. This lesson guides you through the concept of cookies and explains how to set a cookie handler so that your HTTP URL connections will use it.

Java SE provides one main class for this functionality, 
[`java.net.CookieHandler`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/CookieHandler.html), and the following supporting classes and interfaces: 
[`java.net.CookieManager`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/CookieManager.html), 
[`java.net.CookiePolicy`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/CookiePolicy.html), 
[`java.net.CookieStore`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/CookieStore.html), and 
[`java.net.HttpCookie`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpCookie.html).
