
# Steps for the HighScore Developer (Chris)

The steps Chris would take, after creating the `HighScore` and `HighScorePermission` classes, are:

## Compile the Classes

```

javac HighScore*.java -d .

```

## Place the class files in a JAR File

```

jar cvf hs.jar com/scoredev/scores/HighScore*.class

```

## Create a Keystore and Keys for Signing

```

keytool -genkey -keystore chris.keystore -alias signJars

```

Specify whatever you want for the passwords and distinguished name information.

## Sign the JAR File

```

jarsigner -keystore chris.keystore hs.jar signJars

```

## Export the Public Key Certificate

```

keytool -export -keystore chris.keystore
    -alias signJars -file Chris.cer

```

## Supply Files and Information Needed by Game Developers and Users

That is, supply them

- the signed JAR File `hs.jar`,
- the public key certificate file `Chris.cer`, and
- information as to the permissions the `HighScore` and `HighScorePermission` classes must be granted in a policy file in order to work. For this, Chris could supply the exact grant entry needed.
