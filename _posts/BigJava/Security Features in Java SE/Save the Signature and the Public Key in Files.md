
# Compile and Run the Program


[`Here`](examples/GenSig.java) is the complete source code for the `GenSig.java` program, with some comments added. Compile and run it. Remember, you need to specify the name of a file to be signed, as in

```

java GenSig data

```

You can download and use this sample file named
[`data`](examples/data) or any other file you like. The file will not be modified. It will be read so that a signature can be generated for it.

After executing the program, you should see the saved `suepk` (public key) and `sig` (signature) files.
