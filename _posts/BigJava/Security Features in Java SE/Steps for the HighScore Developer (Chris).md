
# Steps for the ExampleGame Developer (Terry)

The steps Terry would take, after creating a game (`ExampleGame` ) that calls the `HighScore` `getHighScore` and `setHighScore` methods to get and set, respectively, the user's high scores, are:

## Compile the Game Class

```

javac ExampleGame.java -classpath hs.jar -d .

```

## Place its class file in a JAR File

```

jar cvf terry.jar com/gamedev/games/ExampleGame.class

```

## Create a Keystore and Keys for Signing

```

keytool -genkey -keystore terry.keystore -alias signTJars

```

Specify whatever you want for the passwords and distinguished name information.

## Sign the JAR File

```

jarsigner -keystore terry.keystore terry.jar signTJars

```

## Export the Public Key Certificate

```

keytool -export -keystore terry.keystore
    -alias signTJars -file Terry.cer

```

## Supply Files and Information Needed by Users

That is, supply them

- the signed JAR File `terry.jar,`
- the public key certificate file `Terry.cer`, and
- information as to the permissions the `ExampleGame` class needs. For this, Terry could supply the exact grant entry needed.

Game users also need files and information from Chris. For their convenience, Terry may forward this information to them:

- the signed JAR File `hs.jar`,
- the public key certificate file `Chris.cer`, and
- information as to the permissions the `HighScore` and `HighScorePermission` classes must be granted in a policy file in order to work. This could be the exact grant entry needed.
