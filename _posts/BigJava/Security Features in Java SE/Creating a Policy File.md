A policy file is an ASCII text file and can be composed via a text editor or the graphical Policy Tool utility demonstrated in this section. The Policy Tool saves you typing and eliminates the need for you to know the required syntax of policy files, thus reducing errors.

This lesson uses the Policy Tool to create a policy file named **`examplepolicy`**, in which you will add a *policy entry* that grants code from the **`examples`** directory permission to write.

Follow these steps to create and modify your new policy file:
