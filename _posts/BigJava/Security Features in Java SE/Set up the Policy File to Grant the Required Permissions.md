
# Open the Policy File

Start Policy Tool by typing the following at the command line:

```

policytool

```

This brings up the Policy Tool window. To open the `examplepolicy` policy file, use the **Open** command in the **File** menu. This will present you with an Open dialog, which you can use to navigate the directory structure until you get to the directory containing the policy file (that is, the `C:\Test\` directory).

Choose the `examplepolicy` file in that directory and then select the **Open** button.

This will fill in the Policy Tool window with information from the `examplepolicy` policy file, including the policy file name and the **CodeBase** part of the policy entry created by the 
[Creating a Policy File](../tour1/index.html) lesson.
