# Lesson: Advanced JavaBeans Topics

Getting started with JavaBeans development is easy, but beans have surprising depth. This lesson covers some more advanced topics, including how beans can be stored (persisted) and how you can supply custom editors for custom data types.

- [Bean Persistence](persistence.html) describes the mechanisms for saving and reconstituting a bean.
- [Long Term Persistence](longpersistence.html) covers representing a bean as XML.
- [Bean Customization](customization.html) provides an overview of creating editor components for custom data types.
