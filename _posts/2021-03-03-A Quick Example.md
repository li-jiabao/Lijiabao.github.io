# A Quick Example

If you're new to internationalizing software, this lesson is for you. This lesson uses a simple example to demonstrate how to internationalize a program so that it displays text messages in the appropriate language. You'll learn how `Locale` and `ResourceBundle` objects work together and how to use properties files.

## [Before Internationalization](before.html)

The first version of the source code contained hardcoded English versions of the messages we want to display. This is NOT how you write internationalized software.

## [After Internationalization](after.html)

This is a sneak preview of what our source code will look like after internationalization.

## [Running the Sample Program](run.html)

To run the sample program, you specify the language and country on the command line. This section shows you a few examples.

## [Internationalizing the Sample Program](steps.html)

Internationalizing the program required just a few steps. You'll be surprised at how easy it was.
