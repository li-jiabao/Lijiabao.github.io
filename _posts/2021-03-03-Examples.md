# Lesson: Preparation for Java Programmer Language Certification

Oracle provides four certification examinations and two certificates for Java SE 8 programmers. The Java Tutorials can be a valuable resource to help you prepare for the certification exams; however, they do not cover all topics in the certification exams. See the [Java SE](https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/ou_product_category.getPage?p_cat_id=267) page on the Oracle University site for more information about Java SE 8 training and certification offered by Oracle.


The following links provide more information on the certification topics and their mapping to tutorial content:
