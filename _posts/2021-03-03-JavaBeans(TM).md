# Trail: JavaBeans(TM)

JavaBeans&#8482; makes it easy to reuse software components. Developers can use software components written by others without having to understand their inner workings.

To understand why software components are useful, think of a worker assembling a car. Instead of building a radio from scratch, for example, she simply obtains a radio and hooks it up with the rest of the car.

This trail describes JavaBeans using the following lessons:

[<img src="../images/javaTrail.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Quick Start**](quick/index.html) provides a speedy introduction to JavaBeans by showing how to build applications with NetBeans.

[<img src="../images/javaTrail.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Writing JavaBeans Components**](writing/index.html) describes the coding patterns used for bean properties, methods, and events. It also outlines the use of a `BeanInfo` to customize the development experience in a builder tool.

[<img src="../images/javaTrail.gif" alt="Trail icon" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" /> **Advanced JavaBeans Topics**](advanced/index.html) covers bean persistence, long term persistence, and customization.
