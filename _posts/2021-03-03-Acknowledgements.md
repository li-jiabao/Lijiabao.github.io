# Lesson: Full-Screen Exclusive Mode API

## **by Michael Martak**

Do you want to use high-performance graphics in the Java development environment? Have you always wanted to program a game, but your images wouldn't move fast enough? Has your slide show program not worked properly because you had no control over the user's display resolution? If you've been asking any of these questions, then the full-screen exclusive mode API, introduced in release 1.4, may be what you're looking for.
