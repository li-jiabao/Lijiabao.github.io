# Lesson: Quick Start

This lesson describes how to use NetBeans to build a simple application. With a good tool like NetBeans, you can assemble JavaBeans components into an application without having to write any code.

The first three pages of this lesson show how to create a simple application using graphic beans that are part of the Java platform. The last page demonstrates how easy it is to incorporate a third-party bean into your application.

- [Creating a Project](project.html) describes the steps for setting up a new project in NetBeans.
- [A Button is a Bean](button.html) shows how to add a bean to the application's user interface and describes properties and events.
- [Wiring the Application](wiring.html) covers using NetBeans to respond to bean events in your application.
- [Using a Third-Party Bean](addbean.html) show how easy it is to add a new bean to the palette and use it in your application.
