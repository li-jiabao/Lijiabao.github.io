The first thing you need is a contract file. You can download and use this very basic sample file named
[`contract`](examples/contract). Or you can use any other file you like. Just be sure to name the file `contract` so it will work with the commands specified in this lesson.

Once you've got the contract file, place it into a JAR file. In your command window type the following:

```

**jar cvf Contract.jar contract**

```

This command creates a JAR file named `Contract.jar` and places the `contract` file inside it.
