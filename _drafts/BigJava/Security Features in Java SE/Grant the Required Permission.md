To save the new policy file you've been creating, choose the **Save As** command from the **File** menu. This displays the **Save As** dialog box.

The examples in the 
[Quick Tour of Controlling Applications](../tour2/index.html) lesson assume that you stored the policy file in the `Test` directory on the `C:` drive.

Navigate to the `Test` directory. Type the file name `examplepolicy` and click **Save**.

The policy file is now saved, and its name and path are shown in the text box labeled `Policy File`.

Exit Policy Tool by choosing **Exit** from the **File** menu.
