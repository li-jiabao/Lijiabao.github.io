Now that you've completed this lesson on regular expressions, you'll probably find that your main references will be the API documentation for the following classes: 
[`Pattern`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html), 
[`Matcher`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html), and 
[`PatternSyntaxException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/PatternSyntaxException.html).

For a more precise description of the behavior of regular expression constructs, we recommend reading the book 
[**Mastering Regular Expressions**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596002890/javasoftsunmicroA/) by Jeffrey E. F. Friedl.
