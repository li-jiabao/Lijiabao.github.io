
# Command-Line I/O Objects

`System` provides several predefined I/O objects that are useful in a Java application that is meant to be launched from the command line. These implement the Standard I/O streams provided by most operating systems, and also a console object that is useful for entering passwords. For more information, refer to 
[I/O from the Command Line](../../essential/io/cl.html) in the 
[Basic I/O](../../essential/io/index.html) lesson.
