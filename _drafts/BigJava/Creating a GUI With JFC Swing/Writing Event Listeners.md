This lesson gives you details about writing event listeners. You might not need to read this section. Your first source of information for event should be the how-to section for the component in question.
<!--
You can find the appropriate section using the 
[Getting Started](../../ui/features/components.html). -->
Each component's section shows code for handling the events most commonly needed when implementing the component. For example, 
[How to Use Check Boxes](../components/button.html#checkbox) shows you how to handle mouse clicks on check boxes using an item listener.

## [Some Simple Event-Handling Examples](intro.html)

The programs in this section illustrate events and event handling.

## [General Information about Writing Event Listeners](generalrules.html)

This section provides information that is useful for handling all types of events. One of the topics includes information on using adapters and inner classes to implement event handlers.

## [Listeners Supported by Swing Components](eventsandcomponents.html)

This is **the** place to find out which Swing components can fire which kinds of events. You might want to bookmark this section so you can easily find its quick-reference table.

## [Implementing Listeners for Commonly Handled Events](handling.html)

This section has detailed information and examples of writing each common kind of event listener.

## [Listener API Table](api.html)

This section features a quick-reference table that shows each listener, its adapter class (if any), and its methods.

## [Solving Common Event-Handling Problems](problems.html)

If you are having some hard-to-debug problems related to handling events, you might find the solution here.
