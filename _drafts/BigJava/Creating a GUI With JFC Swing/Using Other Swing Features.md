This lesson contains a collection of how-to pages to help you use miscellaneous Swing features.

## [How to Integrate with the Desktop Class](desktop.html)

With the `Desktop` class you can enable your Java application to interact with default applications associated with specific file types on the host platform.

## [How to Create Translucent and Shaped Windows](trans_shaped_windows.html)

As of the Java Platform, Standard Edition 6 Update 10 release, you can add translucent and shaped windows to your Swing applications. This lesson shows you how.

## [How to Decorate Components with JLayer](jlayer.html)

`JLayer` is a flexible and powerful *decorator* for Swing components. It enables you to draw on components and respond to component events without modifying the underlying component directly.

## [How to Use Actions](action.html)

With `Action` objects, you can coordinate the state and event handling of two or more components that generate action events. For example, you can use a single `Action` to create and coordinate a tool-bar button and a menu item that perform the same function.

## [How to Use Swing Timers](timer.html)

With the Swing `Timer` class, you can implement a thread that performs an action after a delay, and optionally continues to repeat the action. The action executes in the event dispatch thread.

## [How to Support Assistive Technologies](access.html)

Swing components have built-in support for assistive technologies. Your program can provide even better support by following a few rules.

## [How to Use the Focus Subsystem](focus.html)

Some programs need to manipulate focus &#226;&#128;&#148; for example, to validate input, or change the tab-order of components. This section describes some techniques you can use to customize focus in your program.

## [How to Use Key Bindings](keybinding.html)

With key bindings, you can specify how components react to user typing.

## [How to Use Modality in Dialogs](modality.html)

This section describes a new modality model emerged in the Java&#8482; SE version 6 and enables you to apply different modality types to dialog boxes.

## [How to Print Tables](printtable.html)

This section describes the printing capabilities for tables and explains how to add printing support to your programs.

## [How to Print Text](printtext.html)

This section describes the printing capabilities for text components and explains how to add printing support to your programs.

## [How to Create a Splash Screen](splashscreen.html)

With the `SplashScreen` class you can close the splash screen, change the splash-screen image, obtain the image position or size, and paint in the splash screen.

## [How to Use the System Tray](systemtray.html)

This section describes how to add a tray icon to the system tray and apply a text tooltip, a pop-up menu, ballon messages, and a set of listeners associated with it.

## [Solving Common Problems Using Other Swing Features](problems.html)

This section tells you how to fix problems you might encounter while trying to use the information in this lesson.
