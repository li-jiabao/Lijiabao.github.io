Use the information in this lesson and the component 
[how-to sections](../components/componentlist.html) to help you complete these questions and exercises.

## Questions

1. Find the component that best fits each of the following needs. Write down both the component&#226;&#128;&#153;s common name (such as &#226;&#128;&#156;frame&#226;&#128;&#157;) and find the component's how-to page online.

a. A component that lets the user pick a color.<br />
<br />
b. A component that displays an icon, but that doesn&#226;&#128;&#153;t react to user clicks.<br />
<br />
c. A component that looks like a button and that, when pressed, brings up a menu of items for the user to choose from.<br />
<br />
d. A container that looks like a frame, but that appears (usually with other, similar containers) within a real frame.<br />
<br />
e. A container that lets the user determine how two components share a limited amount of space.

2. Which method do you use to add a menu bar to a top-level container such as a `JFrame`?

3. Which method do you use to specify the default button for a top-level container such as a `JFrame` or `JDialog`?

4. Which method do you use to enable and disable components such as `JButton`s? What class is it defined in?

5. a. Which Swing components use `ListSelectionModel`? [*Hint:* The &#226;&#128;&#156;Use&#226;&#128;&#157; link at the top of the specification for each interface and class takes you to a page showing where in the API that interface or class is referenced.]

b. Do those components use any other models to handle other aspects of the components&#226;&#128;&#153; state? If so, list the other models&#226;&#128;&#153; types.

6. Which type of model holds a text component&#226;&#128;&#153;s content?<br />

## Exercises

1. Implement a program with a GUI that looks like the one shown below. Put the main method in a class named `MyDemo1`.

<img src="../../figures/uiswing/QandE/MyDemo1.png" width="223" height="100" align="bottom" alt="MyDemo1.png" />

<br />
2. Make a copy of `MyDemo1.java` named `MyDemo2.java`. Add a menu bar to `MyDemo2`.

<br />
3. Copy `MyDemo1.java` to `MyDemo3.java`. Add a button (`JButton`) to `MyDemo3.java`. Make it the default button.
