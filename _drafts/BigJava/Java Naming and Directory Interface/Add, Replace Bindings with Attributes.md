One of the most useful features that a directory offers is its **yellow pages**, or **search**, service. You can compose a query consisting of attributes of entries that you are seeking and submit that query to the directory. The directory then returns a list of entries that satisfy the query. For example, you could ask the directory for all entries with a bowling average greater than 200 or all entries that represent a person with a surname beginning with "Sch."

The 
[<tt>DirContext</tt>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/naming/directory/DirContext.html) interface provides several methods for searching the directory, with progressive degrees of complexity and power. The various aspects of searching the directory are covered in the following sections:
