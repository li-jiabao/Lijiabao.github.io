[`CapabilitiesTest`](examples/CapabilitiesTest.java) demonstrates the different buffering capabilities available for the machine on which it is run.


[`DisplayModeTest`](examples/DisplayModeTest.java) shows a Swing application that uses passive rendering. If full-screen exclusive mode is available, it will enter full-screen exclusive mode. If display mode changes are allowed, it allows you to switch between display modes.


[`MultiBufferTest`](examples/MultiBufferTest.java) enters full-screen mode and uses multi-buffering through an active render loop.<br />
