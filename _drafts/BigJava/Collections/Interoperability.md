In this section, you'll learn about the following two aspects of interoperability:

<li>
[Compatibility](compatibility.html): This subsection describes how collections can be made to work with older APIs that predate the addition of `Collection`s to the Java platform.</li>
<li>
[API Design](api-design.html): This subsection describes how to design new APIs so that they will interoperate seamlessly with one another.</li>
