## 
[Interfaces](createinterface.html)

You saw an example of implementing an interface in the previous 
lesson. 
You can read more about interfaces here&#151;what they are for, why you might want to write one, and how to write one.

## 
[Inheritance](subclasses.html)

This section describes the way in which you can derive one class from another. That is, how a *subclass* can inherit fields and methods from a *superclass*. You will learn that all classes are derived from the `Object` class, and how to modify the methods that a subclass inherits from superclasses. This section also covers interface-like *abstract classes*.
