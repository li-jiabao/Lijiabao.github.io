The following quick reference summarizes the operators supported by the Java programming language.

## Simple Assignment Operator

```

=       Simple assignment operator

```

## Arithmetic Operators

```

+       Additive operator (also used
        for String concatenation)
-       Subtraction operator
*       Multiplication operator
/       Division operator
%       Remainder operator

```

## Unary Operators

```

+       Unary plus operator; indicates
        positive value (numbers are 
        positive without this, however)
-       Unary minus operator; negates
        an expression
++      Increment operator; increments
        a value by 1
--      Decrement operator; decrements
        a value by 1
!       Logical complement operator;
        inverts the value of a boolean

```

## Equality and Relational Operators

```

==      Equal to
!=      Not equal to
&gt;       Greater than
&gt;=      Greater than or equal to
&lt;       Less than
&lt;=      Less than or equal to

```

## Conditional Operators

```

&amp;&amp;      Conditional-AND
||      Conditional-OR
?:      Ternary (shorthand for 
        `if-then-else` statement)

```

## Type Comparison Operator

```

instanceof      Compares an object to 
                a specified type 

```

## Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators

```

~       Unary bitwise complement
&lt;&lt;      Signed left shift
&gt;&gt;      Signed right shift
&gt;&gt;&gt;     Unsigned right shift
&amp;       Bitwise AND
^       Bitwise exclusive OR
|       Bitwise inclusive OR

```
