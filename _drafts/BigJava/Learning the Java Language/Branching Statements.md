## The `break` Statement

The `break` statement has two forms: labeled and unlabeled. You saw the unlabeled form in the previous discussion of the `switch` statement. You can also use an unlabeled `break` to terminate a `for`, `while`, or `do-while` loop, as shown in the following 
[`BreakDemo`](examples/BreakDemo.java) program:

```

class BreakDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[] arrayOfInts = 
            { 32, 87, 3, 589,
              12, 1076, 2000,
              8, 622, 127 };
        int searchfor = 12;

        int i;
        boolean foundIt = false;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfInts.length; i++) {
            if (arrayOfInts[i] == searchfor) {
                foundIt = true;
                **break;**
            }
        }

        if (foundIt) {
            System.out.println("Found " + searchfor + " at index " + i);
        } else {
            System.out.println(searchfor + " not in the array");
        }
    }
}

```

This program searches for the number 12 in an array. The `break` statement, shown in boldface, terminates the `for` loop when that value is found. Control flow then transfers to the statement after the `for` loop. This program's output is:

```

Found 12 at index 4

```

An unlabeled `break` statement terminates the innermost `switch`, `for`, `while`, or `do-while` statement, but a labeled `break` terminates an outer statement. The following program, 
[`BreakWithLabelDemo`](examples/BreakWithLabelDemo.java), is similar to the previous program, but uses nested `for` loops to search for a value in a two-dimensional array. When the value is found, a labeled `break` terminates the outer `for` loop (labeled "search"):

```


class BreakWithLabelDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[][] arrayOfInts = { 
            { 32, 87, 3, 589 },
            { 12, 1076, 2000, 8 },
            { 622, 127, 77, 955 }
        };
        int searchfor = 12;

        int i;
        int j = 0;
        boolean foundIt = false;

    search:
        for (i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfInts.length; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j &lt; arrayOfInts[i].length;
                 j++) {
                if (arrayOfInts[i][j] == searchfor) {
                    foundIt = true;
                    break search;
                }
            }
        }

        if (foundIt) {
            System.out.println("Found " + searchfor + " at " + i + ", " + j);
        } else {
            System.out.println(searchfor + " not in the array");
        }
    }
}

```

This is the output of the program.

```

Found 12 at 1, 0

```

The `break` statement terminates the labeled statement; it does not transfer the flow of control to the label. Control flow is transferred to the statement immediately following the labeled (terminated) statement.

## The `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a `for`, `while` , or `do-while` loop. The unlabeled form skips to the end of the innermost loop's body and evaluates the `boolean` expression that controls the loop. The following program, 
[`ContinueDemo`](examples/ContinueDemo.java) , steps through a `String`, counting the occurences of the letter "p". If the current character is not a p, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop and proceeds to the next character. If it *is* a "p", the program increments the letter count.

```


class ContinueDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String searchMe = "peter piper picked a " + "peck of pickled peppers";
        int max = searchMe.length();
        int numPs = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; max; i++) {
            // interested only in p's
            if (searchMe.charAt(i) != 'p')
                continue;

            // process p's
            numPs++;
        }
        System.out.println("Found " + numPs + " p's in the string.");
    }
}

```

Here is the output of this program:

```

Found 9 p's in the string.

```

To see this effect more clearly, try removing the `continue` statement and recompiling. When you run the program again, the count will be wrong, saying that it found 35 p's instead of 9.

A labeled `continue` statement skips the current iteration of an outer loop marked with the given label. The following example program, `ContinueWithLabelDemo`, uses nested loops to search for a substring within another string. Two nested loops are required: one to iterate over the substring and one to iterate over the string being searched. The following program, 
[`ContinueWithLabelDemo`](examples/ContinueWithLabelDemo.java), uses the labeled form of continue to skip an iteration in the outer loop.

```


class ContinueWithLabelDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String searchMe = "Look for a substring in me";
        String substring = "sub";
        boolean foundIt = false;

        int max = searchMe.length() - 
                  substring.length();

    test:
        for (int i = 0; i &lt;= max; i++) {
            int n = substring.length();
            int j = i;
            int k = 0;
            while (n-- != 0) {
                if (searchMe.charAt(j++) != substring.charAt(k++)) {
                    continue test;
                }
            }
            foundIt = true;
                break test;
        }
        System.out.println(foundIt ? "Found it" : "Didn't find it");
    }
}

```

Here is the output from this program.

```

Found it

```

## The `return` Statement

The last of the branching statements is the `return` statement. The `return` statement exits from the current method, and control flow returns to where the method was invoked. The `return` statement has two forms: one that returns a value, and one that doesn't. To return a value, simply put the value (or an expression that calculates the value) after the `return` keyword.

```

return ++count;

```

The data type of the returned value must match the type of the method's declared return value. When a method is declared `void`, use the form of `return` that doesn't return a value.

```

return;

```
