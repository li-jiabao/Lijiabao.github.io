
# Strings

Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In the Java programming language, strings are objects.

The Java platform provides the 
[`String` ](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) class to create and manipulate strings.

## Creating Strings

The most direct way to create a string is to write:

```

String greeting = "Hello world!";

```

In this case, "Hello world!" is a *string literal*&#151;a series of characters in your code that is enclosed in double quotes. Whenever it encounters a string literal in your code, the compiler creates a `String` object with its value&#151;in this case, `Hello world!`.

As with any other object, you can create `String` objects by using the `new` keyword and a constructor. The `String` class has thirteen constructors that allow you to provide the initial value of the string using different sources, such as an array of characters:

```

char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' };
String helloString = new String(helloArray);
System.out.println(helloString);

```

The last line of this code snippet displays `hello`.

## String Length

Methods used to obtain information about an object are known as **accessor methods**. One accessor method that you can use with strings is the `length()` method, which returns the number of characters contained in the string object. After the following two lines of code have been executed, `len` equals 17:

```

String palindrome = "Dot saw I was Tod";
int len = palindrome.length();

```

A *palindrome* is a word or sentence that is symmetric&#151;it is spelled the same forward and backward, ignoring case and punctuation. Here is a short and inefficient program to reverse a palindrome string. It invokes the `String` method `charAt(i)`, which returns the i<sup>th</sup> character in the string, counting from 0.

```


public class StringDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String palindrome = "Dot saw I was Tod";
        int len = palindrome.length();
        char[] tempCharArray = new char[len];
        char[] charArray = new char[len];
        
        // put original string in an 
        // array of chars
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
            tempCharArray[i] = 
                palindrome.charAt(i);
        } 
        
        // reverse array of chars
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; len; j++) {
            charArray[j] =
                tempCharArray[len - 1 - j];
        }
        
        String reversePalindrome =
            new String(charArray);
        System.out.println(reversePalindrome);
    }
}

```

Running the program produces this output:

```

doT saw I was toD

```

To accomplish the string reversal, the program had to convert the string to an array of characters (first `for` loop), reverse the array into a second array (second `for` loop), and then convert back to a string. The 
[`String` ](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html) class includes a method, `getChars()`, to convert a string, or a portion of a string, into an array of characters so we could replace the first `for` loop in the program above with

```

palindrome.getChars(0, len, tempCharArray, 0);

```

## Concatenating Strings

The `String` class includes a method for concatenating two strings:

```

string1.concat(string2); 

```

This returns a new string that is string1 with string2 added to it at the end.

You can also use the `concat()` method with string literals, as in:

```

"My name is ".concat("Rumplestiltskin");

```

Strings are more commonly concatenated with the `+` operator, as in

```

"Hello," + " world" + "!"

```

which results in

```

"Hello, world!"

```

The `+` operator is widely used in `print` statements. For example:

```

String string1 = "saw I was ";
System.out.println("Dot " + string1 + "Tod");

```

which prints

```

Dot saw I was Tod

```

Such a concatenation can be a mixture of any objects. For each object that is not a `String`, its `toString()` method is called to convert it to a `String`.

```

String quote = 
    "Now is the time for all good " +
    "men to come to the aid of their country.";

```

Breaking strings between lines using the `+` concatenation operator is, once again, very common in `print` statements.

## Creating Format Strings

You have seen the use of the `printf()` and `format()` methods to print output with formatted numbers. The `String` class has an equivalent class method, `format()`, that returns a `String` object rather than a `PrintStream` object.

Using `String's` static `format()` method allows you to create a formatted string that you can reuse, as opposed to a one-time print statement. For example, instead of

```

System.out.printf("The value of the float " +
                  "variable is %f, while " +
                  "the value of the " + 
                  "integer variable is %d, " +
                  "and the string is %s", 
                  floatVar, intVar, stringVar); 

```

you can write

```

String fs;
fs = String.format("The value of the float " +
                   "variable is %f, while " +
                   "the value of the " + 
                   "integer variable is %d, " +
                   " and the string is %s",
                   floatVar, intVar, stringVar);
System.out.println(fs);

```
