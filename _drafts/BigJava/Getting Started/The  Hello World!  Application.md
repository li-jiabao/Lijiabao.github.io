The sections listed below provide detailed instructions for compiling and running a simple "Hello World!" application. The first section provides information on getting started with the NetBeans IDE, an integrated development environment that greatly simplifies the software development process. The NetBeans IDE runs on all of the platforms listed below. The remaining sections provide platform-specific instructions for getting started without an integrated development environment. If you run into problems, be sure to consult the common problems section; it provides solutions for many issues encountered by new users.


["Hello World!" for the NetBeans IDE](netbeans.html) These instructions are for users of the NetBeans IDE. The NetBeans IDE runs on the Java platform, which means that you can use it with any operating system for which there is a JDK 7 available. These operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Solaris OS, Linux, and Mac OS X. We recommend using the NetBeans IDE instead of the command line whenever possible.


["Hello World!" for Microsoft Windows](win32.html) These command-line instructions are for users of Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Home, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 Professional, and Windows Vista.


["Hello World!" for Solaris OS and Linux](unix.html) These command-line instructions are for users of Solaris OS and Linux. 
[Common Problems (and Their Solutions)](../problems/index.html) Consult this page if you have problems compiling or running your application.
