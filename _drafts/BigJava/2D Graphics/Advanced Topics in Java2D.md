# Lesson: Advanced Topics in Java2D

This lesson shows you how to use `Graphics2D` to display graphics with fancy outline and fill styles, transform graphics when they are rendered, constrain rendering to a particular area, and generally control the way graphics look when they are rendered. You'll also learn how to create complex `Shape` objects by combining simple ones and how to detect when the user clicks on a displayed graphics primitive. These topics are discussed in the following sections:

## [[Transforming Shapes, Text, and Images]]

This section shows you how to modify the default transformation so that objects are translated, rotated, scaled, or sheared when they are rendered.

## [[Clipping the Drawing Region]]

You can use any shape as a **clipping path**--the area within which rendering takes place.

## [[Compositing Graphics]]

This section illustrates the various compositing styles supported by `AlphaComposite` and shows you how to set the compositing style in the `Graphics2D` rendering context.

## [[Controlling Rendering Quality]]

This section describes the rendering hints that `Graphics2D` supports and shows you how to specify your preference in the trade-off between rendering quality and speed.

## [[Constructing Complex Shapes from Geometry Primitives]]

This section shows you how to perform boolean operations on `Shape` objects using the `Area` class.

## [[Supporting User Interaction]]

This section shows you how to perform hit detection on graphics primitives.
