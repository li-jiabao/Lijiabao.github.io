The Deployment Toolkit script is a set of JavaScript functions that can help developers deploy rich Internet applications (RIAs) consistently across various browser and operating system configurations. The Deployment Toolkit script evaluates the underlying browser and operating system, and deploys the RIA with the correct HTML. This script can also ensure that the required version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) software is present on the client machine. The Deployment Toolkit script was introduced in the Java Platform, Standard Edition 6 update 10 release.
